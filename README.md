🧠 Brain Tumor Detection using Machine Learning

📌 Overview

This project aims to detect brain tumors from MRI scan images using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The model classifies images into Tumor or No Tumor, and in an advanced version, it can categorize tumor types.

🚀 Roadmap

🔹 Phase 1: Understanding the Problem & Collecting Data

⏳ Time Estimate: 1-2 Days

Problem Definition:

Detect tumors in MRI scan images.

Binary Classification → Tumor vs. No Tumor

Advanced: Multi-class classification (Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary Tumors)

Dataset Collection:

📂 Best Public Datasets:

Brain Tumor MRI Dataset (Kaggle)

BraTS 2021 (Brain Tumor Segmentation)

Dataset Format: MRI images (.jpg, .png, .nii.gz)

🔹 Phase 2: Data Preprocessing & Augmentation

⏳ Time Estimate: 3-5 Days

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

Convert images to grayscale (if needed)

Resize images to 224x224 pixels

Normalize pixel values (0-1 scaling for CNN compatibility)

Apply Skull Stripping (optional) to remove unnecessary parts

Data Augmentation:

Transformations: Rotation, Flipping, Zooming, Contrast Stretching

🔹 Phase 3: Model Selection & Training

⏳ Time Estimate: 7-10 Days

Model Choices:
✅ CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) – Best for image classification✅ Transfer Learning (VGG16, ResNet, InceptionV3) – High accuracy✅ Hybrid CNN + LSTM (for sequential MRI processing)


🔹 Phase 4: Model Evaluation & Optimization

⏳ Time Estimate: 5-7 Days

Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

Loss vs. Epochs & Accuracy vs. Epochs Visualization

Performance Improvements:
✅ Hyperparameter Tuning (learning rate, batch size, dropout)
✅ Data Balancing (SMOTE, Focal Loss)
✅ Ensemble Learning (Combine multiple models)

🔹 Phase 5: Explainability & Visualization

⏳ Time Estimate: 3-5 Days
